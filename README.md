## Installing the app using a Scratch Org

1. Set up your environment. Follow the steps in the [Quick Start: Lightning Web Components](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quick-start-lightning-web-components/) Trailhead project. The steps include:

   - Enable Dev Hub in your Trailhead Playground
   - Install Salesforce CLI
   - Install Visual Studio Code
   - Install the Visual Studio Code Salesforce extensions, including the Lightning Web Components extension

1. If you haven't already done so, authorize your hub org and provide it with an alias (**myhuborg** in the command below):

   ```
   sfdx auth:web:login -d -a myhuborg
   ```

1. Clone the lwc-recipes repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mmousiou/lwcWinter23Demo.git
   ```

1. Create a scratch org and provide it with an alias (**winter-23-release-notes** in the command below):

   ```
   sfdx force:org:create -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a winter-23-release-notes
   ```

1. Push the app to your scratch org:

   ```
   sfdx force:source:push
   ```

1. Assign the **Winter_Release_23** permission set to the default user:

   ```
   sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n Winter_Release_23
   ```

1. Import sample data:

   ```
   sfdx force:data:tree:import -p ./data/data-plan.json
   ```

1. Open the scratch org:

   ```
   sfdx force:org:open
   ```

1. In App Launcher, click **View All** then select the **Winter '23 release notes** app.

## Installing the App using a Developer Edition Org or a Trailhead Playground

Follow this set of instructions if you want to deploy the app to a more permanent environment than a Scratch org.
This includes non source-tracked orgs such as a [free Developer Edition Org](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) or a [Trailhead Playground](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/).

Make sure to start from a brand-new environment to avoid conflicts with previous work you may have done.

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mmousiou/lwcWinter23Demo.git
   ```

1. Authorize your Trailhead Playground or Developer org and provide it with an alias (**mydevorg** in the command below):

   ```
   sfdx auth:web:login -s -a mydevorg
   ```

1. Run this command in a terminal to deploy the app.

   ```
   sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app
   ```

1. Assign the `Winter_Release_23` permission set to the default user:

   ```
   sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n Winter_Release_23
   ```

1. Import some sample data.

   ```
   sfdx force:data:tree:import -p ./data/data-plan.json
   ```

1. If your org isn't already open, open it now:

   ```
   sfdx force:org:open -u mydevorg
   ```

1. In App Launcher, select the **Winter '23 release notes** app.
